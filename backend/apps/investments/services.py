"""
ROI Engine + Investment Activation Service Layer
=================================================
Pure Python business logic for:
  - activate_investment()         — called when admin approves a deposit
  - distribute_direct_income()    — 2% per level to upline's OLDEST active plan
  - distribute_roi_for_investment() — weekly ROI to investor wallet + upline plan credits
  - credit_oldest_active_plan()   — core helper: credits a user's oldest ACTIVE investment
  - update_user_active_level()    — recalculate sponsor tree level

All DB operations are atomic.
